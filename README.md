#Contact Manager
##Purpose

Allows add, view and delete of contacts stored as JSON objects.

##Tech

Created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Implements [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) design and uses [FireBase](firebase.com) as storage.

[JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) was used for storage in the original material, but that causes a bug when trying to delete newly added contact entries.
